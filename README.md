What the Product Class Does

The Product class represents a single product in an e-commerce application, encapsulating all relevant details about the item and providing methods to interact with its properties. Here’s a breakdown of its functionality:

Purpose

	•	Encapsulation: The class uses private attributes to encapsulate product details, ensuring that they are only accessible through controlled interfaces.
	•	Data Management: It manages product information such as ID, name, price, and stock level, which are crucial for e-commerce operations.
	•	Inventory Control: The class provides a method to update stock levels, facilitating inventory management and preventing overselling.

Key Responsibilities

	1.	Store Product Information
	•	The class holds product-specific data such as a unique identifier, name, price, and stock quantity. This information is stored as private attributes to protect the integrity of the data.
	2.	Provide Controlled Access
	•	Through the use of public getter methods, the class allows other parts of the system to retrieve product information without directly accessing the private attributes. This approach supports encapsulation and data hiding.
	3.	Enable Inventory Management
	•	The updateStock method allows for dynamic adjustment of stock levels, supporting operations such as sales, returns, and restocking. The ability to increase or decrease stock ensures accurate inventory tracking.
	4.	Support Sales Operations
	•	By providing access to key product attributes like price and availability, the class supports sales-related activities such as displaying products, calculating costs, and verifying stock before completing transactions.

Design Considerations

	•	Private Attributes: The use of private access modifiers for attributes ensures that the internal state of the product is protected and can only be manipulated through the provided methods.
	•	Getter Methods: By offering getter methods, the class allows controlled access to its attributes, promoting encapsulation and reducing the risk of unintended data manipulation.
	•	Flexible Stock Management: The updateStock method offers flexibility in managing inventory, allowing for both increases and decreases in stock levels based on business needs.
